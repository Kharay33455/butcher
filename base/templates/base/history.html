            Over the past 10 years, Kaizen has evolved from an eight-person start up to a global company who’s
            trusted to manage more assets than any other investment manager. The past decade have shown our
            commitment to our platform, our people and our technology so that we can continue to deliver long-term value
            for our clients and our shareholders.
        </p>

        <p class="principles-text">
            Kaizen began in 2014 with eight people in a single room who shared a determination to put clients’ needs
            and interests first. Our founders believed they could manage assets in a way that was better for their
            clients – by utilizing their passion for understanding and managing risk. This is the way the firm continues
            to be managed today.
        </p>
        <p class="principles-text">
            Recognizing the opportunity to bring transparency, scale and innovation to risk management for the broader
            industry, Kaizen begins to sell its proprietary technology. This technology, integral to who we
            are as a firm, is embedded in everything we do, thus differentiating us as an investment and risk manager.
